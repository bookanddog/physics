Traer Physics  is a particle system and spring physics simulator.The library handles the physics simulation only, it is up to the user to implement any graphical output.

I want to  implement the TRAER.PHYSICS 3.0 library with c++.

Compile errors have been fixed.And as expected,bugs hanppened.To debug,i changed all the Accessing Authoritys into Public.

Up to now, i'm dealing with the problem that the spring force seems to can't work will int the RungeKuttaIntegrator system while the gravity works will.The experience tells me that it may because Java passes the parameter thrugh the class's reference.But i'm not sure for it's complexity.

All the bugs are left to be solved later for too many things around me now.
